##### Responsive design

## Make it Your Own!

#### 1. Make sure you have what you need
To build this website, you will need to have Node >=6 downloaded and installed on your machine.

#### 2. Build a Create-React-App
Next, build the initial application using Create-React-App. This allows you to get up and running with a React app without the headache of setting up build-tool configurations. Go [HERE](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) to get started. When the app building is finished run cd yourappname and run npm start to test it out. Hit ctrl+c in the terminal when you want to stop the server that the above command starts. For this project we will also need to install Axios, do this by running npm install axios --save and npm install axios --save in your terminal while inside your project folder. YOU MUST RUN THESE COMMANDS.

#### 3. Download the template
Once you have a React app up and running by following the steps in the above link, download my code by hitting the green "clone or download" button above and hit download zip.

#### 4. Acces Open Weather App API
Next, you will want to fetch your weather data. You can do so by creating a free account on openweathermap.org

#### 5. Create your personal API Key
First, validate your e-mail (find instructions on your mailbox). Then, create your personal API key.

#### 6. Update API key and make any styling changes you would like
On fetchWeater.js replace const API_Key with your own personal api key 

#### 7. Enjoy your new Weather App
When you're all done, run npm start again and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
